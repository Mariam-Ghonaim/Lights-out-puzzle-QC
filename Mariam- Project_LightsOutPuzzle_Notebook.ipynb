    "However, I guess now I have a sense of what to do and how to approach the problem. First, we need to dentify our classical function to help us identify the winner state. Second, use this classcal function in the oracle and then apply the diffuser which is the difficut part. Finally, apply Grover's algorithm to find the wanted state. \n"
